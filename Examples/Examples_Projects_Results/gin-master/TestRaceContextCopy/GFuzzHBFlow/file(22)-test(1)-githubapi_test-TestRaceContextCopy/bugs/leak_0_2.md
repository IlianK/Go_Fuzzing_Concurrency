# Leak: Leak on sync.Mutex

The analyzer detected a leak on a sync.Mutex.
A leak on a sync.Mutex is a situation, where a sync.Mutex lock operations is still blocking at the end of the program.
A sync.Mutex lock operation is a operation, which is blocking, because the lock is already acquired.

## Test/Program
The bug was found in the following test/program:

- Test/Prog: TestRaceContextCopy
- File: /home/ilian/Projects/Go_Fuzzing_Concurrency/Examples/Examples_Projects/gin-master/githubapi_test.go
