# Leak: Leak on routine

The analyzer detected a leak on a routine without a blocking operations.
This means that the routine was terminated because of a panic in another routine or because the main routine terminated while this routine was still running.
This can be a desired behavior, but it can also be a signal for a not otherwise detected block.

## Test/Program
The bug was found in the following test/program:

- Test/Prog: TestFlagCompletionConcurrentRegistration
- File: /home/ilian/Projects/Go_Fuzzing_Concurrency/Examples/Examples_Projects/cobra-main/completions_test.go

## Bug Elements
The elements involved in the found leak are located at the following positions:

###  Routine: End
-> /home/ilian/Projects/Go_Fuzzing_Concurrency/Examples/Examples_Projects/cobra-main/completions.go:175
```go
164 ...
165 
166 // RegisterFlagCompletionFunc should be called to register a function to provide completion for a flag.
167 //
168 // You can use pre-defined completion functions such as [FixedCompletions] or [NoFileCompletions],
169 // or you can define your own.
170 func (c *Command) RegisterFlagCompletionFunc(flagName string, f CompletionFunc) error {
171 	flag := c.Flag(flagName)
172 	if flag == nil {
173 		return fmt.Errorf("RegisterFlagCompletionFunc: flag '%s' does not exist", flagName)
174 	}
175 	flagCompletionMutex.Lock()           // <-------
176 	defer flagCompletionMutex.Unlock()

181 	flagCompletionFunctions[flag] = f
182 	return nil
183 }

185 // GetFlagCompletionFunc returns the completion function for the given flag of the command, if available.
