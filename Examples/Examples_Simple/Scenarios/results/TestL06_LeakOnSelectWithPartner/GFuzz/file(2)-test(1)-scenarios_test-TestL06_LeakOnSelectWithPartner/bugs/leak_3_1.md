# Leak: Leak on routine

The analyzer detected a leak on a routine without a blocking operations.
This means that the routine was terminated because of a panic in another routine or because the main routine terminated while this routine was still running.
This can be a desired behavior, but it can also be a signal for a not otherwise detected block.

## Test/Program
The bug was found in the following test/program:

- Test/Prog: TestL06_LeakOnSelectWithPartner
- File: /home/ilian/Projects/Go_Fuzzing_Concurrency/Examples/Examples_Own/Scenarios/scenarios_test.go

## Bug Elements
The elements involved in the found leak are located at the following positions:
