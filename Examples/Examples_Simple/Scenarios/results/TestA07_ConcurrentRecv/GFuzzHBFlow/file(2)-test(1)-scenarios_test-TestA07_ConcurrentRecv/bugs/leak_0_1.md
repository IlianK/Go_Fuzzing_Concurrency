# Leak: Leak on unbuffered channel without possible partner

The analyzer detected a Leak on an unbuffered channel without a possible partner.
A Leak on an unbuffered channel is a situation, where a unbuffered channel is still blocking at the end of the program.
The analyzer could not find a partner for the stuck operation, which would resolve the leak.

## Test/Program
The bug was found in the following test/program:

- Test/Prog: TestA07_ConcurrentRecv
- File: /home/ilian/Projects/Go_Fuzzing_Concurrency/Examples/Examples_Own/Scenarios/scenarios_test.go

## Bug Elements
The elements involved in the found leak are located at the following positions:

###  Channel: Receive
