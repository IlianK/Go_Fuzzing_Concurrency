// Given a send/recv on a closed channel, rewrite the trace to make the bug
// occur. The trace is rewritten as follows:
// We assume, that the send/recv on the closed channel did not actually occur
// in the program run. Let c be the close and a the send or receive operation.
// The global trace then has the form:
// ~~~~
// T = T1 ++ [a] ++ T2 ++ [c] ++ T3
// ~~~~~~
// We now, that a, c and all Elements in T2 are concurrent. Otherwise, a possible send/recv on close would not be possible. We can therefor reorder the trace in the following manner:
// ~~~~
// T = T1 ++ [X_s, c, a, X_e]
// ~~~~~~
// For send on close, this should lead to a crash of the program. For recv on close, it will probably lead to a different execution of program after the
// object. We therefor disable the replay after c and a have been executed and
// let the rest of the program run freely. To tell the replay to disable the
// replay, by adding a stop character X_e.

// Create a new trace for send/recv on closed channel
// Let c be the close, a the send/recv, X a start marker, X' a stop marker and
// T1, T2, T3 partial traces.
// The trace before the rewrite looks as follows:
//
//   - T1 ++ [a] ++ T2 ++ [c] ++ T3
//
// We know, that a, c and all elements in T2 are concurrent. Otherwise the bug
// would not have been detected. We are also not interested in T3. For T2
// we only need the elements, that are before c. We call the subtrace with those
// elements T2'. We can therefore rewrite the trace as follows:
//
//   - T1 ++ T2' ++ [X, c, a, X']
//
// Parameter:
//   - trace *trace.Trace: Pointer to the trace to rewrite
//   - bug Bug: The bug to create a trace for
//   - exitCode int: The exit code to use for the stop marker
//
// Returns:
//   - error: An error if the trace could not be created
